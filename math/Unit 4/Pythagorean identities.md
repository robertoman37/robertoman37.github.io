## Deriving the Pythagorean Identities
Recall that the pythagorean theorem is described by $a^2+b^2=c^2$. We can use this equation to derive a plethora of trigonometric identities. The main pythagorean identity can be derived as such.
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$
$$\frac{a^2}{c^2}+\frac{b^2}{c^2}=\frac{c^2}{c^2}$$
$$\bigg(\frac{a}{b}\bigg)^2+\bigg(\frac{b}{c}\bigg)^2=1$$
In this case, since a is the adjacent side and b is the opposite side...
$$\cos^2\theta+sin^2\theta=1$$
This is the easiest way to derive the main pythagorean identity, however if you're a masocist and want to know the other way, here it is
$$c\sin\theta=b$$
$$c\cos\theta=a$$
$$if\ a^2+b^2=c^2,$$
$$(c\cos\theta)^2+(c\sin\theta)^2=c^2$$
$$c^2\cos^2\theta+c^2\sin^2\theta=c^2$$
$$\frac{c^2\cos^2\theta+c^2\sin^2\theta}{c^2}=\frac{c^2}{c^2}$$
$$\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta=1$$
We can also easily modify this to solve for other values. Here are the two most common ones
$$1-\cos^2\theta=\sin^2\theta$$
$$1-\sin^2\theta=\cos^2\theta$$

## Deriving the Other Pythagorean identities
We can use the main pytagorean identity to derive the others. The first one we derive by dividing $\cos^2\theta$ on both sides. For this derivation we need to know that $\tan\theta=\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$ and that $\frac{1}{\cos\theta}=\sec\theta$ and $\frac{1}{\sin\theta}=\csc\theta$. Don't worry, these will be derived later.
$$\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta=1$$
$$\frac{\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta}{\cos^2\theta}=\frac{1}{\cos^2\theta}$$
$$1+\tan^2\theta=\sec^2\theta$$

We can derive the next one smiliarly by simply dividing $\sin^2\theta$ on both sides.
$$\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta=1$$
$$\frac{\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta}=\frac{1}{\cos^2\theta}$$
$$1+\cot^2\theta=\csc^2\theta$$
