# General Area Formula
## Derivation
If we have a non-right triangle with sidelengths a, b, c, like this:
<br>[insert image here]
<br>The area formula can be derived like this:<br>
$$Area=\frac{1}{2}lh\\
h=b\sin{C}\\
\therefore Area=\frac{1}{2}ab\sin{c}$$
## Using the General Area Formula
To use this formula, you need two sides and the angle between them.
