Below are several different vocab words relating to angles.
### **Initial Side**
* The ray you are rotating to form the angle. Often lies on the positive x-axis
```desmos-graph
left=-1.15; right=1.15;
top=0.75; bottom=-0.75;
---
y=-x|-1<x<0|black
y=0|0<x<1|black
x^2+y^2=0.25|-0.3536<x<0.5|y>0|blue
(0.1, 0)|open|label:Initial Side|black
```
---
### Terminal side
* The resulting ray once the initial side is rotated.
```desmos-graph
left=-1.15; right=1.15;
top=0.75; bottom=-0.75;
---
y=-x|-1<x<0|black
y=0|0<x<1|black
x^2+y^2=0.25|-0.3536<x<0.5|y>0|blue
(-0.25, 0.25)|open|label:Terminal Side|black
```
---
### Standard Position
* An angle whose vertex is at the origin and the initial side on the positive x-axis
* The below is an example of an angle in standard form
```desmos-graph
left=-1.15; right=1.15;
top=0.75; bottom=-0.75;
---
y=x|0<x<0.5|black
y=0|0<x<0.65|black
x^2+y^2=0.25|x>0.3536|y>0|blue
```
---
### Positive Angle
* An angle whose terminal side is rotated counterclockwise around the origin
* The below is an example of a positive angle
```desmos-graph
left=-1.15; right=1.15;
top=0.75; bottom=-0.75;
---
y=\frac{1}{2}x|0<x<0.55|black
y=0|0<x<0.6|black
x^2+y^2=0.25|x>0.4472|y>0|blue
```
---
### Negative Angle
* An angle whose terminal side is rotated clockwise around the origin
* The below is an example of a negative angle
```desmos-graph
left=-1.15; right=1.15;
top=0.75; bottom=-0.75;
---
y=-\frac{1}{2}x|0<x<0.55|black
y=0|0<x<0.6|black
x^2+y^2=0.25|x>0.4472|y<0|blue
```
---
### Coterminal Angles
* Two angles that share the same initial and terminal sides. Subtract or add multiples of $360\degree$ or $2\pi$ to find them.
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{
    \begin{array}[b]{r}
      75\degree\\
      + 360\degree
    \end{array}
  }{
    435\degree
  }
\end{equation}$$
* The above is a positive coterminal angle
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{
    \begin{array}[b]{r}
      75\degree\\
      - 360\degree
    \end{array}
  }{
    -285\degree
  }
\end{equation}$$
* The above is a negative coterminal angle.

### Reference Angles
* A positive acute angle formed by the terminal side and the x-axis
