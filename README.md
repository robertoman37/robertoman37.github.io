# Info
Some notes and other things from my classes<br>
Just know that (for now) things will be added and removed. This notebook is VERY under construction as I merge my notes from OneNote to markdown.<br>

# Contributing Guidelines
If you want to add some notes, raise a github issue with everything you would like in it and (if I want to) I will add it<br>
If you find a spelling error and really want it to get fixed (for some reason) just raise a github issue with the exact line and I will fix it (There's a LOT of spelling error so if you report every one of them it will take a bit)

# **IMPORTANT**
You MUST Download this repository and open it in obsidian to view it correctly. Once in obsidian, navigate to the extensions tab and download the desmos extension. Cloning will likely be better because it will allow you to stay up-to-date with changes, but downloading is easier. You may also need to unzip the file once done downloading.<br>

# Brief to markdown fomatting
If you want to contribute but you don't know markdown formatting, read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github). Markdown tables are... ok, but html tables are SO much more expandable. Read about them [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp). If you have any questions, there might be a chat feature in github, but idk.
