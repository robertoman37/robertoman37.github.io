# Unit 7 - Industrial Revolution
# Industrial Revolution Introduction
* ### Intro
	* In the mid-1700s, an Industrial Revolution began in England that transformed the way work was done
	* Rather than making goods by hand, new machines mass-produced products which lowered costs, increased profits, and changed the way people lived
	* By 1900, industrialization spread through Europe and to the United States transforming the West into the dominant region in the world
* ### Before Industrial Revolution
	* Most Europeans worked and lived in small farming villages using inefficient methods of farming
	* Farmers Relied on the medieval and inefficient three-field system
* ### During the Industrial Revolution
	* Few farmers experimented with new farm techniques
	* As a result, the food that was produced kept the population of Europe from growing rapidly
* ### New farming techniques
	* In the mid-1700s new farm techniques led to an Agricultural revolution in Europe
	    * Fences were used to protect large farms (called the enclosure movement)
		* Scientific farming methods like crop rotation maximized farmland and increased production
		* New crops like corn and potatoes were introduced
		* New tools like the iron plow and seed drill made farming more efficient
	* As a result of this agricultural revolution, more food was made and Europe's population increasedâ€¦
* ### This large population of workers who would soon find work in industrial factories
	* All of these factories would eventually cause concern of air pollution
* ### The industrial Revolution began in England for a variety of reasons
	* England had large deposits of natural resources, especially iron and coal
	* England had banks, a government that encouraged trade and invention, and money to invest in industry
	* England's colonies provided cheap raw materials and markets to sell industrial goods
* ### From 1750 to 1850, England as the most industrialized nation in the world
* ### The population boom created a demand for clothing but traditional methods of textile making were slow
	* As a result, the textile industry became the first to become industrialized
	* Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin stimulated a demand for cotton textiles
* ### New textile machinery led to the factory system
	* Power-driven machines were able to mass-produce goods very fast and cheap
	* Factory owners made huge profits selling mass-produced clothes
* ### The textile industry and the rise of the factory system led to the growth of other industries
	* Factories led to a demand for faster transportation
	* Roads and canals were built in England; Robert Fulton's steamboat increased the speed of water travel
	* The Greatest improvement to transportation was the steam-powered railroad RRs were fast, increased profits, and stimulated the iron and coal industries
	* The Industrial Revolution led to an increase in coal to power factories and RRs
	* Iron was needed to produce new machines, engines, and railroad tracks
	* By 1800, England made more iron than all other nations in the world combined
	* Henry Bessemer invented a cheap process for making steel which is stronger than iron
	* Steel allowed engineers to design more powerful machines, taller buildings, and longer bridges
  * Other inventions of the industrial Revolution include electricity, new forms of communication such as the telegraph and telephone, business machines like typewriters and cash registers, and medical improvements like vaccines
* ### Conclusions
	* From 1700 to 1900, revolutions in agricultures, industry, transportation, and communication changed Western Europe and the United States
	* Industrialization gave Europe tremendous economic and military power
	* Industry also had numerous negative effects on working conditions and the standard of living for urban workers
# Economic Systems
* ## Capitalism
    >It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. <br>*- Adam Smith*
    * ### Defininitions
        * >**Capitalism** - an economic system based on *private* ownership and the use of capital
        * >**Capital** - Wealth in the form of property or money that is used to make more money
        * >***Laissez faire*** - letting owners of industry and business set working conditions without interference
    * ### Three main ideas
        * >**private ownership** - people are free to use their capital as they choose
        * >**profit Motive** - When enought people demand a product, producers will supply it because they want to make a profit (law of supply and demand)
        * >**Market Economy** - buyers and sellers are free to exchange goods and services, with prices determined by supply and demand
    * ### Positive effects:
        * Competition led to progress
        * Encourages economic growth
    * ### Negative effects:
        * Unequal distribution of wealth led to social unrest
* ## Socialism
     >**Socialism** - an economic system which factors of production are owned by the government
    * ### Government actively regulates the economy
        * Controls major industries and resources
        * Provides social security, unemployment benefits, minimum wages, etc.
  * ### Examples
      * Fire department
      * Cobb County
* ## Communism
     > **Communism** - an economic system in which all means of production are owned by the people, private property does not exist, and all goods and services are shared equally
    * ### The Industrial Revoltuion intensified class truggle (rich vs. Poor)
        * "Haves" (bourgeoisie) take of "have-nots" (proletariat)
    * ### Believe that in a Capitalist system:
        * The labor of workers profits employers
        * The labor of workers are exploited by employers
    * ### Marx believed that there are 3 types of alienation in a capitalist society
        1. The worker is alienated from what (s)he produces
        2. The worker is alientated from him/herself
        3. people are alienated from each other
    * ### Marx and Engels called for workers of the world to unite and overthrow the rule of the rich
        * Wealth would be redistributed based on need
        * Classes and private property would cease to exist
    * ### Effects
        * **Positive Effects**:
            * Everyone's need are provided for
            * Can eliminate social unrest
        * **Negative Effects**:
            * No incentive to work
            * Frequent shortages
    * ### True communism requires a command economy
        * >**Command economy**: the central government makes **all** important decisions int he best interest of the society
        * Government took control of land, factories, banks, etc.
        * Government decided what would be produced, what crops would be grown, and what would be charged for them
    * ### There have been no purely communist countries
        * How can a country be commnist when pure communism doesn't allow for governments, countries, or class divisions
        *  According to Marx, communism should have no government
    * ### Communism in practice
        * "Communist" countries have been run by dictators or have been cominated by a single political party
        * These governments were supposed to be povisional, but dictators never gave up control
* ## Karl Marx
  * ### Marx believed that socialism was the midpoint between Capitalism and Communism
      * German journalist
      * Radical Socialist
      * Wrote "*The Communist Manifesto*"
# Industrial Revolution Continued
* ## The factory system was a major change for European workers:
    * Factory work became less skilled
    * Factory conditions were dirty, dangerous, and unwealthy
    * Workers worked long hours (12-16 hr day)
    * Factory workers were not paid well; Women and children were paid less than men
    * Owners required workers "clock in" and limited their breaks to increase production
* ## The invention of the steam engine increased demand for coal:
    * Coal production grew from 5 millions in 1750 to 23 million tons in 1830
    * Men, Women, Children were used in mines
    * Mines were unhealthy and dangerous
        * Mines were unhealthy and dangerous: Lung disease, poison gas, drowning, explosions, and cave-ins were common for workers
* ## The Industrial Revolution changed the lives of many children
    * Rather than working for their parents on family farms, many children in the cities worked in factories, brickyards, or mines
    * Living in cities was expensive, so poor families needed their kids to work
    * Child workers earned 10% of an adult wage, worked long hours in dangerous conditions, and were often beaten
* ## The Industrial Revolution changed the lives of many women
    * Rather than working with their husbands on family farms and taking care of children, poor women in cities worked in factories
    * Some women worked as domestic servants
    * Factory jobs for women required long hours away from their children and could leave women crippled, sick, or deformed
    * Women were paid <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of a man's salary
* ## Urbanization increased dramatically
    * The increase in population and ecnlosure of farms forced peple to move to cities
    * Poor families lived in poorly constructed apartments built by factory owners called tenements in neightborhoods called slums
    * Many families shared cramped apartments that lacked running water or sanitation
    * Hard factory jobs and disease led to short life expectancies for urban workers
* ## During the Industrial Revolution, the social class system changed as ownership of land stopped being the most important factor:
    * At the top were the industrial capitalists who gained wealth by owning factories
    * The middle class grew because of growth of engineers, managers, shopkeepers
    * The bottom class grew because of the size of the urban poor who worked for low wages in factories
* ## How did people respond to the changes and abuses of the Industrial Revolution?
    * **Reform**
        * Some demanded reforms to fix problems caused by the Industrial Revolution
        * In the mid-1800s, Britain and the U.S. passed child and women labor laws that limited hours and type of work they could perform
        * Reformers regulated water, food, sewage; Offered public education; Regulated living and work conditions
    * **Unions**
        * Workers joined unions and demand better pay, fewer hours, safer work conditions
        * When unions demands were not met, workers went on strike
    * **New Economic Theories**
        * As discussed in the economic systems section
# Imperialism
*   From 1850 to 1914, the strong, industrialized nations of Europe used imperialism to seize colonies and dominate the local government and economies in Africa and Asia
    * From 1880 to 1914, European nations used imperialism to dominate the continent of Africa
        * Europeans wanted to colonize Africa for their resources which were very useful for industrialization
        * Resources included coal, iron, diamonds, and gold
    * Forces driving imperialism
        * >**Economic factors** - industrial Revolution provided Europeans the need for large markets
        * >**Political Factors** - Territory = power
        * >**Social Factors** - Empires were viewed as a measure of national pride
        * >**Social Darwinism** - Steam, and industrial weapons encouraged the conquest of Africa
    * White Man's burden
        * European countries used the "White Mans Burden" to jusify imperialism
        * >**White Man's Burden** - the alleged duty of the white peoples to manage the affairs of the less developed nonwhite peoples
    * The Industrial Revolution lead to European nations becomeing stronger and wealthier
        * They also had better guns and techn
        * Additionally, they could produce these guns faster than ever before
        * One of the significant inventions was the Gatling gun
* **The first modern total war**[^1]
    * >**Total war** - war against armies and civillians
* **Britian burned Boer farms, imprisoned women and children in concentration camps**
    * 1902 - Britain created South Africa
* The race for African colonies was so fiece that Europeans became afraid wars would break out
    * In 1884, 14 nations met at the Congress of Berlin to "set the rules" for colonizing in Africa
    * Any nation could claim land in Africa by notifying other nations and showing it could control the area
    * No African nations were invited to attemd; No concerned was given to ethnic divisions in Africa
    * By 1914, Europeans controlled 90% of Africa
        * France took control of most of west AFrica
        * Belgium claimed the Congo in central Africa
        * Germany has colonies throughout Africa
    * These nations used African colonies to gain diamonds, tin, gold, rubber and built cash-crop plantations
* The most dominant imperial power in AFrica was Great Britain
    * British industry fueled demand for raw materials
    * Britian claimed colonies in Egypt and in East Africa
    * In 1882, Britian seized control of the Suez Canal from a French company
    * Britian seized control of South Africa from the Dutch
    * Many citizens in England dreamed of a British colony from "Capetown to Cairo"
* What was the impact of European colonization in the Congo
    * Europeans introduced new technoloiges like railroads, telegraph lines, and steamboats...
        * But transportation routes only connected areas that benefited European businessmen
    * Europeans brought an end to the slave trade...
        * But Africans were paid low wages and exploited
# British Imperialism in China
* ### The Chinese have always referred to themselves as the "Middle Kingdom"
    * The Chinese viewed outsiders as barbarians and saw little value in trade with foreign merchants
    * The Great Wall was built to protect China from barbarian attacks
    * But, outsiders came across the SIlk Road for China's exotic goods
    * As a result, China became the dominant empire in Asia (and the world)
* ### China ecentually did trade which helped spread CHinese culture throughout Asia
    * But, outside merchants always had to obey Chinese rules and show respect
* ### In 1644, northern invaders called Manchus conquered China and created the Qing dynasty
    * Qing China faced 2 challenges that would threated China's future strength
        1. A population boom led to a rise in the number of Chinese peasants and competition for land
        2.  European missionaries and merchants arrived in Asia with hopes of trading with China
            * In 1793, Chinese Emperor Qian Long wrote a letter to answer a request for trade by British King George III
            * The Chinese had little interest in trading with the West and were able to reject trade offers
            * China had a healthy agricultural economy, large deposits of natural resources, and manufactured products like silk, cotton, clothes, and porcelain
* ### For decades, China exported goods to European merchants but refused to by European merchants
    * The British were desperate to find a product that the Chinese would buy...
    * In the 1800s, the British smuggled opium from India into China
    * By 1835, 12 million Chinese citizens were addicted to opium
    * THe CHinese outlawed opium sales and appointed Commissioner Lin to end opium smuggling
    * When Britain refused to end the opium trade, Commissioner Lin appealed directly to British Queen Victoria
* ### The British refused to end the opium trade and China declared war on Britian
    * Britain used its modern navy to easily win the Opium Wars (1839 - 1942)
    * The Treaty of Nanjing ended the Opium Wars: Britain recieved Hong Kong and extraterritorial rights in China (Foreigners were not subject to Chinese laws)
* ### In adition to its foreign problems, China also faced major problems with its own people
    * By 1850, China's population grew so rapidly that agriculture could not keep up
    * In 1853, Hon Xiuquan led the Taiping Rebellion in an attempt to end provety among peasants
    * The Qing defeated the rebels in 1864 but the rebellion killed 20 million people and weakened China
* ### Britain and other industrial powers took advantage of CHina's weakness to force China to sign unequal trade treaties in particular ports
    * By 1900, China was carved into a series of spheres of influences: areas where a foreign nation had exclusive trade rights
* ### The division of China worried the USA that it would be shut out of Chinese trade
    * In 1899, the USA proposed an Open Door Policy in China so merchants can trade freely
* ### The growth of foreign influence, poverty among peasants, and Christianity upset many Chinese people
    * In 1900, frustrated Chinese led the Bozer Rebellion to expel foreigners from China
    * An army of 19,000 British soldiers finally ended the Boxer Rebellion
* ### The power of foreign imperialist and the violence of the Boxer Rebellion led to calls to reform China

* ### The Japanese did more than trade with the Dutch, they also learned from them about new Western ideas
    * **These "Dutch Studies" helped Japan learn about some of the new scientific and industrial technologies in Europe**
* ### From 1640 to 1853, Japan was isolated while the rest of Asia became imperialized by Western powers

# Indian Colonization
## Intro
* ### Setting the Stage
    * In the 1600s, Britian was interested in trading in Asian markets
    * Over the next 100 years, British East India Ccmpany setup trading posts throughout India
## British East India Company
* Over time, Britian would gain more control over India
    * 1700: Mughal Empire declined, allowing Europe to fill power vacuum
    * 1760s: Britain gained French territory after Seven Years War

# German Unification
## Growing Nationalism
* One important effect of the Englightenment, French Revolution, and conquests by Napoleon was the growth of nationalism
* Nationalism is the belief that people's loyalty should be to the people in one's country who share a common culture and history rather than a king or empire
