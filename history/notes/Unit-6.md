## Absolute Monarchy
---
* ### By the end of the Renaissance, new nations were formed in Europe
	* Many of these nations were ruled by powerful kings with unlimited power known as absolute monarchs

	* European nations used mercantilism to gain wealth from their American colonies
	* Catholic missionaries from Spain and France
	* One major impact of European colonization was the unequal social hierarchy

		* Peninsulares were royal governors sent by the king to enforce mercantilism and maintain order in the colony
		* Spanish colonists living in America were called creoles; They had land and wealth but no political power

## Gunpowder Empires
---
* ### From 1300 to 1700, three "gunpowder empires" dominated parts of Europe, Africa and Asia
	* The Ottoman Empire
	* The Safavid Empire
	* The Mughal Empire
* ### These empires were unique but shared some similarities:
	* All 3 empire were able to conquer neighboring people because they formed strong armies using rifles and artillery
	* All 3 empires were Islamic and ruled by Muslim leaders with well-organized government made up of loyal bureaucrats
	* All 3 empires blended their culture with neighboring societies to create a high point of Islamic culture
* ### Around 1300, the Muslim Turks of Anatolia were unified and formed the Ottoman Empire
	* The Ottomans used muskets and cannons to form a powerful army and expand their territory
	* The Ottoman army included 30,000 elite soldiers called janissaries who were slaves that were trained to be loyal to the government
	* In 1453, the Ottomans attacked Constantinople and conquered the Byzantine Empire
	* By the late 1600s, the ottomans expanded into the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe
	* Ottoman rules were called sultans and they governed with absolute power
		* The greatest Ottoman sultan was Suleyman the Magnificent who came to power in 1520
			* Under Suleyman, Ottoman armies attacked Europe and the empire reached its height
			* By the mid-1500s, Suleyman was the most powerful king in the world
			* Suleyman's greatest accomplishment was creating a stable government for his empire
			* He was known as "Suleyman the Lawgiver" because he created a law code that governed
			* He created a simplified and fair tax system to raise money for his empire
			* He granted freedom of worship to Christians and Jew living in the empire
			* Art, architecture, and poetry flourished under Suleyman as the Ottoman Empire experienced a cultural renaissance
		* To maintain their power against rivals, Suleyman and other Ottoman sultans executed their brother and jailed their sons which led to progressively weaker leaders
		* By the outbreak of the World War I in 1914, the Ottoman Empire was so weak it was known as the "sick man of Europe"
* ### The Safavid Empire
	* The Safavids were Turks living in Persia who built a powerful gunpowder army and crated an empire in modern-day Iran
	* Unlike the Ottomans who were Sunni Muslims, the Safavids believed in Shi'a Islam and strictly converted the people they conquered
	* The Safavids were Turks living in Persia who built a powerful gunpowder army and created an empire in modern-day Iran
	* Safavid rulers were called shahs, using the Persian title for king
	* The greatest rule of the Safavid Empire was Shah Abbas who came to power in 1587
	* Abbas borrowed ideas from outside groups to improve the Safavid Empire
	* He modeled Ottoman janissaries, used merit to employ government worked, and introduced religious toleration which helped Safavids trade with European Christians
	* Art flourished, especially carpets that blended Persian and European designs
	* Like the Ottomans, Shah Abbas blinded or killed his most capable sons in order to keep power
	* As a result, weak leaders led to a rapid decline of the Safavid Empire
	* While The Ottoman Empire lasted until 1922, the Safavid Empire fell in 1747
* ### The Mughals
	* The Mughals were Muslims who descended from Turks, Afghans, and Mongols living in central Asia
	* Like the Ottomans and Safavids, the Mughals built a powerful army with guns and cannons
	* In 1494, Babur became king of the Mughals, expanded the army, and began invasion into India to create his empire
	* In 1556, Babur's grandson Akbar became king of the Mughal Empire and expanded the empire into almost all of India
	* Akbar was the greatest of all Mughal rulers
		* Akbar's greatest achievement was cultural blending and religious toleration
		* He held religious discussion with Hindu and Muslim scholars
		* He ended the tax that non-Muslims were required to pay and created a fair and affordable tax system
		* Because he was Muslim ruling in a largely Hindu region, Akbar allowed non-Muslims to worship freely
		* He married many wives, among them were Muslim, Hindu, and Christian women
	* The Divine Faith was an example of syncretism because it blended ideas from Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism
	* Akbar hoped the Divine would end conflicts between Muslims and Hindus
	* But, the Divine Faith never attracted many Muslim or Hindu converts… When Akbar died, so did the Divine Faith
	* During Akbar's right, art flourished
		* Mughal artists were known for their colorful paintings
	* Mughal architecture was known for blending of Hindu and Islamic designs
		* The greatest example of Mughal architecture is the Taj Mahal which was built in 1631 by Shah Jahan
	* The Mughal Empire grew weak by 1700 as kings spent too much money on palaces and war
	* In addition, the large population of Hindus in India began to Revolt against their Muslim rules
	* Great Britain took advantage of this weakness and conquered India, and removed the last Mughal emperor from power in 1858
* ### Conclusions
	* The Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals built large Islamic empires using gunpowder militaries
	* The empires provided new contributions in law, art, and religion
	* But, their decline by the 1800s allowed newly industrialized European nations to dominate Asia
