### Intro
* **From 1914 to 1919, World War I erupted in Europe**
    * This "**Great War**" was the largest, most destructive war the world had yet seen
    * WWI was a **global war** that altered the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century

### Growing Tensions

* **Acronym**
    >**M**ilitarism <br>
    >**A**lliances  <br>
    >**I**mperialism<br>
    >**N**ationalism<br>
* **Militarism**
    * The Industrial Revolution led to large, advance militaries in Europe
    * Europeans believed that to be great, nations had to have strong militaries
    * As a result, an arms race began among European nations, especially between Britian and Germany
    * Nations glorified military power and kept an army prepared for war (called militarism)
    * Having a strong army increased patriotism among citizens
* **Alliances**
    * Growing rivalries among nations led to the formation of two military alliances that threatened to draw European nations into war
        * **Germany**, **Italy**, and **Austria-Hungary** made up the **Triple Alliance**
        * **England**, **France**, and **Russia** formed the Triple Entente
* **Imperialism**
    * European nations competed fiercely for colonies in Africa and Asia
        * Competition for colonies often pushed Europeans to the brink of war
        * This competition increased European rivalry and mistrust
        * Germany and France almost went to war three times over Morocco
* **Nationalism**
    * Rivalries due to militarism and imperialism increated nationalism among European powers
    * European rivals tried to maintain a balance of power while also trying to overpower each other
    * While nationalism unified people in the powerful nations, it was dividing people in weakening empires
        * No region was more tense in the years before World War I than the Balkans<br>
        ![map of Balkan Peninsula](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F564x%2F83%2Fb5%2Fdd%2F83b5ddd6a97c09b25349172e656ebde0.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=7afb86461e3cfe50a3e52ed8a7daf2c7388a06cca160107b5503c5dd4d06e5d6&ipo=images)[^1]

    * Germany's solution was the Schlieffen Plan which involved quickly defeating France in the West
    * Then sending troops to the East before Russia was fully mobilized for war
    * The Schlieffen Plan seemed to be working when the German army marched through Belgium and France, within miles of Paris
    * But, English and French troops saved Paris at the Battle of the Marne
    * Meanwhile, Russia mobilized faster than expected, so Germany had to diver troops from France
* **Because the Schlieffen Plan failed, the Central Powers were forced to fight a two-front war**
    * The fighting between Germany and France was known as the **Western Front**
    * The fighting between Germany and Russia was known as the **Eastern Front**

* **The Reality**
    1. **Hiroshima**
        * 70,000 Japanese deaths
        * Plus approximitely 70,000 died later of radiation

## Holocaust
### Nazi Ideology
* **Nazi Racism:**
    * idea that the Germans, or Aryans, were the "Master race"
    * all non-Aryans were inferior; especially the Jews
    * Doesn't just fit the Jews, but manufactured to fit them
* **Anti-Semitism**
    > **Anti-Semitism** - Hated of Jewish people
    * Labeled "untermenschen" (sub-human)
    * Long existed in Western Europe
    * During the depression of the 1920s Hitler claimed the entire Jewish community were anti-German and the source of the nation's problems
    * Jewish leaders also played a dominate role in the acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919
* **After 1920s:**
    * Jews became the national enemy of Germany

### Policies
* **First solution**:
    * **Nuremburg Laws** - laws passed to reduce the right of Jewsih people in Germany
    * ex. German and Jews could not marry
* **Kristallnacht:**
    * Night of "broken glass"
    * terror campaign against Jewish synagogues and Jewish owned businesses
* **Isolation:**
    * All Jews were forced to wear a patch with the Star of David
    * > **Ghettos** - Germans began moving Jews into designated cities then into run down parts of the city known as ghettos
    * > **Concentration camps** - Hitler moved Jews out of the cities to work camps that forced the Jews to work for the Nazi's. Stripper the Jewish community of individuality, taking away all their belongings
* **Final Solution:**
    * Concentration camps became death camps
        * e.x. Auschwitz
    * Hitler's plan for genocide or killing off of the Jews
    * SS troops (Hitler's security force) became killing squads that searched through all German controlled territories hunting down Jews

### Modes of Killings
* **In the first years of the war, the gas chambers of the later Nazi concentration camps were not yet common.**
* **Most victims were taken in groups to secultded areas where they were stripped of clothing, pushed into open pits, machine-gunned, and then quickly covered over, in many cases even before all of the them were dead**

### Consequences of the Holocaust
* **The slaughter of an estimated 6 million Jews (does not include Roman-Gypsies, Slavs, Poles, Handicapped, among others)**
* **Nurembreg Trials: Nazi leaders brought to trial for "crimes against humanity" (Holocaust)**
* **The Holocaust matters today because the violence against the Jews led to the founding of Israel after World War II**

### Aftermath
* **General Eisenhower inspects a camp in 1945**
