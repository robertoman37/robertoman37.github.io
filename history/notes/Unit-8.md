## World War I
### Intro
* **From 1914 to 1919, World War I erupted in Europe**
    * This "**Great War**" was the largest, most destructive war the world had yet seen
    * WWI was a **global war** that altered the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century

### Growing Tensions
* **From 1870 to 1914, a number of developments gradually increased tensions among the European powers that led to the outbreak of World War I**

### Causes of WWI
* **Acronym**
    >**M**ilitarism <br>
    >**A**lliances  <br>
    >**I**mperialism<br>
    >**N**ationalism<br>
* **Militarism**
    * The Industrial Revolution led to large, advance militaries in Europe
    * Europeans believed that to be great, nations had to have strong militaries
    * As a result, an arms race began among European nations, especially between Britian and Germany
    * Nations glorified military power and kept an army prepared for war (called militarism)
    * Having a strong army increased patriotism among citizens
* **Alliances**
    * Growing rivalries among nations led to the formation of two military alliances that threatened to draw European nations into war
        * **Germany**, **Italy**, and **Austria-Hungary** made up the **Triple Alliance**
        * **England**, **France**, and **Russia** formed the Triple Entente
* **Imperialism**
    * European nations competed fiercely for colonies in Africa and Asia
        * Competition for colonies often pushed Europeans to the brink of war
        * This competition increased European rivalry and mistrust
        * Germany and France almost went to war three times over Morocco
* **Nationalism**
    * Rivalries due to militarism and imperialism increated nationalism among European powers
    * European rivals tried to maintain a balance of power while also trying to overpower each other
    * While nationalism unified people in the powerful nations, it was dividing people in weakening empires
        * No region was more tense in the years before World War I than the Balkans<br>
        ![map of Balkan Peninsula](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F564x%2F83%2Fb5%2Fdd%2F83b5ddd6a97c09b25349172e656ebde0.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=7afb86461e3cfe50a3e52ed8a7daf2c7388a06cca160107b5503c5dd4d06e5d6&ipo=images)[^1]
            * Serbia, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania broke from the Ottoman Empire to create new nations
            * The Slavic people in Serbia wanted ot unify all Slavs but Aurstria-Hungary opposed to giving up the largely Slavic territories Bosnia and Herzegovina
            * The Balkans became a "powder keg" waiting for a spark to blow up

### The Outbreak of World War I
* **Serbians vowed to take Bosnia and Herzegovnia from Austria-Hungary**
    * On June 28<sup>th</sup>, 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated by a Serbian terrorist
        * On July 23<sup>th</sup>, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia: turn over conspirators and allow and investigation or go to war
        * When Serbia balked at some of the terms, Austria-Hungary declared war on June 28<sup>th</sup>, 1914
    * Russia had a large population of Slavs and was an ally of Serbia; Russia moved troops to the Austrian border
    * These events set off a chain reaction that started World War I

### World War I begins
* **Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and its ally Russia**
    * On August 1<sup>st</sup>, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia
    * On August 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1914, Germany declared war on France
    * On August 4<sup>th</sup>, 1914, England declared war on Germany and Asutria-Hungary
    * Italy backed out of its agreement with Germany and Austria-Hungary and joined the Allies
* **During the war, Germany and Austria-Hungary became the Central Power; They were joined by Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire**
* **The members of the Triple Entente became known as the Allied Powers and eventually were joined by many nations throughout the world**

## World War I continued
### Europe at the start of the war
* **When the war began in August 1914, Europeans were enthusiastic about fighting**
    * Most people anticipated that the war would be over by Christmas 1914... they were wrong

### The Schlieffen Plan
* **When the war began, Germany's biggest problem was the potential of fighting on two fronts**
    * Germany's solution was the Schlieffen Plan which involved quickly defeating France in the West
    * Then sending troops to the East before Russia was fully mobilized for war
    * The Schlieffen Plan seemed to be working when the German army marched through Belgium and France, within miles of Paris
    * But, English and French troops saved Paris at the Battle of the Marne
    * Meanwhile, Russia mobilized faster than expected, so Germany had to diver troops from France
* **Because the Schlieffen Plan failed, the Central Powers were forced to fight a two-front war**
    * The fighting between Germany and France was known as the **Western Front**
    * The fighting between Germany and Russia was known as the **Eastern Front**
* **By 1915, the war settled into a stalemate as each side fortified their positions with trenches**
