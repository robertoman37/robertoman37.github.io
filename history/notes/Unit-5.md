## Protestant reformation
* During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church was the dominant religion in Western Europe
* Without a common government in Europe, the Catholic Pope became an important political leader
* On the manor, priests were powerful because they controlled people's access to heaven by delivering the sacraments and absolving sins
* The Catholic Church taught that people gain access to heaven (called salvation) by having faith and doing good works for others
* Practices of the Catholic Church
    * The church taught that Christians could gain more of God's grace through a series of spiritual rituals called the Holy Sacraments
    * Sacraments included baptism, Confirmation, Communion, Confession, Marriage, Ordination of Priests, and Last Rites for the Dying
* But, the church was also growing corrupt
    * Clergy members took vows of chastity to abstain from sex… but some church leaders fathered children
    * Priests were required to go through rigorous training in a monastery… but some church position were sold to the highest bidder called simony
    * Sometimes, feudal lords would use their power to have friends or children named as priests, called lay investiture
    * As a result, some clergy members were poorly educated
    * One of the most corrupt church practices was  the selling of indulgences
    * Indulges began as a way for people to repent for their sins through good works
    * But rather than selling good deeds, church leaders began selling indulgence certificates as a way of raising money
* These practices went unquestioned during the Middle Ages
* By the time of the Renaissance, some Christians began criticizing church corruption and questioned Catholic teachings
* Christian humanists believed that they could help reform the Catholic Church
    * In the 1300s, Reformers like Jon Wycliffe and priest Jan Hus attacked corruptions like indulgences, said that the Bible (not the Pope) was the ultimate authority on Christianity, and wanted church teachings in the vernacular (local language) not Latin
    * Catholic leaders responded to these criticisms by executing Wycliffe and Hus
    * In 1509, Christian humanist Erasmus published Praise of Folly which called to an end to the corruption
    * As a result of Johann Gutenberg's invention of the moveable-type printing press in 1453, Erasmus' book spread through Europe and increased calls for church reform
* The protestant Reformation
    * By the early 1500s, the Catholic Church was in turmoil over the controversy of corruption and its unwillingness to adopt reforms
    * In Germany, a Catholic monk named Martin Luther became involved in a serious dispute with the Catholic Church
    * Martin Luther's break from the Catholic Church began the Protestant Reformation and inspired a series of new Christian denominations
* Martin Luther
    * He became a priest
    * After studying the Bible as a monk, Martin Luther became a priest and scholar
    * During his studies of the Bible, Luther became convinced that salvation could not be achieved by good works and sacraments
    * Instead, Luther was inspired by St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans: "A person can be made good by having faith alone in God's mercy"
    * Martin Luther believe that salvation was gained through having faith in God; He called this idea Justification by Faith
    * Martin Luther was also deeply troubled by the church's selling of indulgences, which he saw as false salvation
    * In 1517, Matin Luther wrote a list of arguments against church practices called the "Ninety-Five Theses"
    * He posted the Ninety-Five Theses on the church door in the town of Wittenberg and welcome debate of his ideas
    * The "Ninety-Five Theses" spread quickly through Europe causing an incredible controversy

* King Henry VIII
	* Henry VIII was king of England
	* Had grown very tired of Catholic Pope taking English land (Church controlled 1/3 of good land in England) and asked for large tithe (tax) on England's treasury
	* Wanted divorce from wife because she could not bear him a male child; Pope refused
	* He wished to have a male heir for his throne, and married six times to have a male child.
		* The divorce from Catherine of Aragon created the Anglican church
	* Henry was furious and asked Parliament to declare Act of Succession in 1534 - made Church of England (Anglican Church)
		* New Protestant faith based heavily on ideas of Catholic church, BUT
		* Monarch of England would be ultimate authority, not Pope
	* Basic ideas of Anglicanism:
		* Belief in original sin, so Baptism is necessary ritual
		* Salvation achieved by faith alone (justification by Faith)
		* King is authority of Church with hierarchy of bishops and priests
		* Bible and church services were in English (vernacular)
	* In 1517, after Matin Luther's 95 Theses and the Diet of Worms (where Martin Luther gets excommunicated from the church due to his unwillingness to recant), the first Protestant faith began (Lutheranism)
	* In 1534, Henry VIII of England created Anglicanism (church of England) as a reaction against the Pope's power (king vs. Pope)
* Calvinism
	* John Calvin was born in France and became Protestant (some who protested against Catholic Church) but left for Switzerland because of oppression in France (France was a VERY Catholic nation)
	* In 1536, he started a new Protestant faith called Calvinism
	* Basic ideas of Calvinism:
		* Predestination - God determined those who are going to heaven and hell before people are born
		* Those going to heaven (called "the Elect") were chosen by God to be saved and would avoid all sin
		* "The Elect" should rule society as government leaders (type of government called a Theocracy)
		* Overthrow government leaders (like Kings) who didn't prove to be "elect" ( if they committed sin)
		* Church rules are also laws; committing a sin is breaking the law and should be punishable by a legal court system
	* Calvinists live by strict code to avoid sin (called Protestant Work Ethic):
		* Cannot dance, sing, gamble, swear, got to theater, drink alcohol, wear jewelry or bright clothing
		* Church 5x a week; in bed by 9:00
		* Kids can have only Christian names
		* Homes inspected once a year
		* Punishment for breaking rules; excommunication, exile, death
		* Calvinists believed that hard work and obeying code would show that they were "elect" and were going to heaven
	* Calvin established theocratic community in Geneva, Switzerland with 20,000 citizens
	* Geneva became successful model for other Calvinist communities
* John Knox
	* Scottish preacher who visited Geneva and put Calvinist ideas into place in Scotland in 1559
	* Communities were led by leaders called presbyter, so followers of Knox became Presbyterians
	* In 1567, Knox and the Presbyterians overthrew the Catholic queen and established Calvinism as the official religion of Scotland

* The counter-reformation
	* During the Protestant Reformation, religious reformers called protestants broke from the Catholic Church and started new Christian denominations
	* In the 1500s, the new protestant faiths spread, especially into northern Europe in areas away from the power of the Catholic Church
	* But most Europeans, especially in Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy stayed with the Catholic Church which remained the largest religion in Europe but it had lost much of its power and influence
	* The response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant reformation became known as the Counter-Reformation (or the Catholic Reformation)
* Society of Jesus (Jesuits)
	* One of the first reformers in the Catholic Church was Ignatius of Loyola who formed the Society of Jesus in 1540
		* Members of the Society of Jesus were called Jesuits and focused on three goals:
			* Jesuits formed schools to better educate Catholic priests
			* Jesuits tried to stop the spread of Protestantism
			* Jesuits sent missionaries around the world to convert non-Christians to Catholicism
* In 1545, Pope Paul III created a committee of Catholic leaders to review church practices, known as the Council of Trent
	* Over the next 18 years, the Council of Trent made a series of reforms
		* The Catholic Church stopped selling false indulgences
		* New schools were created to educate priests
	* The Council of Trent also reaffirmed several core Catholic beliefs and practices
		* The Church's interpretation of the Bible is final and all others who interpret the Bible are heretics (non-believers)
		* Salvation is gained through faith in God and good works
		* All seven Holy Sacraments are legitimate means to gain God's grace
	* To enforce these beliefs, the Church used the Inquisition to accuse, hold trials, and punish heretics
	* The Church banned and burned all offensive books, including Protestant bibles
* The impact of the reformation
	* The Protestant Reformation left Europe religious divided
	* Numerous religious wards were fought between Catholic and Protestants
	* The weakened authority of the Pope helped kings gain power and form nations
	* Missionaries converted non-Christians throughout the world
	* The Reformation encouraged education and the questioning of long-held beliefs

* Scientific revolution
	* Scientific Revolution
		* A movement in 1600s in which new technology and innovative approaches to seeking knowledge led to a breakthrough in European thought. (Everything was questioned; nothing was assumed)
	* Logic
		* During the Scientific Revolution, logic (reasoning) were utilized as tools to find truth; Logic - using the mind and science to determine answers
		* How did people come up with answers before Scientific Revolution?
			* Magical Thought (witch did it)
			* Religious Thought (God did it)
			* Scientific Thought (using logic)
	* Deductive Reasoning
		* Observing something general and using logic to prove a hypothesis (unproven question)
		* Use Scientific Method to prove hypothesis
	* Scientific Method
		* Thought - Observation of something in nature
		* Form Hypothesis - come up with a question about observation
		* Experimentation - conduct tests to determine answers to hypothesis
		* Confirmation - analyze and interpret data to see if hypothesis is true
	* Inductive Reason
		* Observing something specific and using logic to make a general statement
	* Reasons for Scientific Revolution
		* Renaissance - emphasis on order, perfection, ok to question traditional beliefs, humans can accomplish anything
		* Reformation - Catholic Church did not always support scientific thought; new religious weakened Church authority
