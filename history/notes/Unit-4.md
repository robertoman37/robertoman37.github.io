# Unit 4 - Africa and Mesoamerica
## Africa
* Africa's geography was very diverse and Africans lived differently based on where they lived
* The dense trees and lack of edible vegetation in the humid rain forest make it an unwelcoming environment in south Africa
* The Sahara is the world's largest desert and acted as a barrier to separate North Africa from sub-Saharan Africa
* Early societies of north Africa were influenced by Mediterranean cultures such as the Phoenicians and Romans
* By 750, North Africans were part of the Islamic Empire, converted to Islam, and shared Arabic culture
	* Those countries are mostly Islamic today
* African societies south of the Sahara were isolated and missed out on the cultural diffusion of the Classical Era
* While the societies of sub-Saharan Africa were diverse, they shared some similarities:
	* Most societies lived in farming villages in family-based clans
	* Few societies had written languages; Histories were shared orally by storytellers (griots)
	* Made iron tools
* Sub-Saharan people were polytheistic: 
	* Practiced animism, a religion in which spirits exist in nature and play a role in daily life
* Over the course of 4,000 years, Bantu people of central Africa migrated south in search of farmland
* These Bantu migrations helped spread new farming and ironworking techniques
* The societies of East Africa participated in the Indian Ocean trade network and were shaped by cultural diffusion:
	* The kingdom of Aksum trade with Persia, India, Arabia, and Rome; Aksum became a Christian kingdom
* Arab merchants introduced Islam to East African trade cities
	* The mix of African and Arab cultures led to a new Swahili language
	* Towns had mosques and were ruled by a Muslim sultan
	* But many people kept their traditional religious beliefs
* Kingdom of Aksum
	* Achievements
		* Controlled North East African trade
		* Written Language
		* Spread Christianity in Northern and Eastern Africa
		* Terrace Farming
		* Built Stelae
		* Gold-Salt Trade (Trans-Saharan trade)
* West Africa was shaped by the trans-Saharan trade network:
	* West African had large deposits of gold, but lacked salt
	* Gold-salt trade connected North and West Africa
	* The gold-salt trade increased cultural diffusion with Muslim merchants:
		* Islam was introduced in West Africa and slowly gained converts
		* Many Africans blended Islam with animism or never converted
* Ghana
	* The gold-salt trade led to wealth and empires in West Africa
		* By 800, Ghana became an empire by taxing merchants, building a large army, and conquering surrounding people
		* Ghana kings served as religious leaders, judges, and generals
* Mali
	* Eventually Ghana was overthrown and the Mali empire emerged
		* Mali's Ling Sundiata took over the Ghana kingdom and trade cities in West Africa
		* Sundiata created an efficient government, promoted farming, and controlled trade
	* The kings who ruled Mali after Sundiata converted to Islam
	* The most important king was Mansa Musa:
		* He built a 100,000 man army to keep control over Mali
		* He divided Mali into provinces ruled by appointed Governors
	* Mansa Musa was a devout Muslim and went on a hajj to Mecca in 1324
	* Mansa Musa passed out gold nuggets to the people he met along the way
	* When he returned from Mecca, Mansa Musa built mosques throughout Mali, including Timbuktu
		* This trade city attracted scholars, doctors, religious leaders
		* It had a university and became an important center for learning
* Songhai
	* After Mansa Musa, Malik declined and was replaced by Songhai
		* Kings gained control of trade cities along the gold-salt routes
		* Songhai grew into the largest of the West African empires
		* Its fall in 1491 ended a 1,000 year era of empires in West Africa
## Mesoamerica
* While classical civilizations were developing in the Mediterranean and Asia
* Advanced societies were developing in isolation in the Americas
* During the Ice Age, prehistoric nomads migrated across the land bridge between Asia and America
* During the Neolithic Revolution, these nomads settled into farming villages; Some of which became advanced civilizations
* Olmecs
	* The first American civilization were people known as the Olmec in an area known as Mesoamerica
	* The Olmecs are often called the "mother culture" because they influenced other Mesoamerican societies
	* The Olmecs developed a strong trade network in Mesoamerica that brought them great wealth
	* The Olmecs used their wealth to build large stone monuments and pyramids to honor their leaders and gods.
	* Olmec trade allowed them to spread their culture to other Mesoamericans
	* For unknown reasons, the Olmec civilization decline by 400 BC but their cities and symbols influenced later cultures, especially the Mayans
* Mayans
	* While the Olmecs were in decline around 400 BC, the Mayans were evolving and borrowed many Olmec ideas
	* Important events are recorded on stone monuments called "steles"
	* Tikal largest Maya city
	* Government
		* Mayans were divided into individual city-states ruled by king-gods

	* Religion
		* Mayans were polytheistic and offered their blood, good, and sometimes human sacrifices to please the gods
	* Technology
		* Mayans invented a writing based on pictures called glyphs, an accurate 365-day calendar, and advanced temples
	* Around 800 AD, the Mayans mysteriously declined perhaps due to warfare among Mayan city-states and over-farming
* Aztecs
	* After the decline of the Mayans, the Aztecs were developing in present-day Mexico
	* Around 1200, Aztecs arrived in Mexico and built their city Tenochtitlan in 1325
	* Government
		* The Aztecs formed a massive empire, controlled it thought 38 provinces, and received tribute from conquered peoples
	* Economy
		* They survived on tribute and farming; They built "floating gardens" (chinampas)
	* Society:
		1.  Kings
		1.  Nobility
		1.  Commoners
		1.  Slaves
	* Religion
		* Aztecs worshipped many gods, especially the sun god and made thousands of human sacrifices each year
	* Technology
		* Like the Mayans, the Aztecs developed an accurate calendar and built advanced temples
	* Around 1500 AD, the Aztecs began to decline; A century of brutal rule over the provinces and millions of human sacrifices led to revolts
	* But, the true demise of the Aztecs came when the Spanish discovered America and conquered the Aztecs
* Incas
	* While the Aztecs ruled Mexico the Incas began to dominate the area of the Andes Mountains of South America
	* Many Incan cities like Machu Picchu and Cuzcu were built in the mountains
	* Government
		* Like the Aztecs, the Incas built a vast empire which included 80 provinces
	* But the Incas ruled with tolerance and unified their empire with roads, schools, and a common language

		* Inca innovations included Quipu, a means of record keeping involving knotted ropes as well as an extensive system of roads and suspension bridges
	* In the 1520s, a civil war divided and weakened the Incan Empire; Ten years later Spanish conquistadors conquered the empire
## Age of Exploration
* From the 1400s to the 1700s, Europe experienced an "Age of Exploration"
* The Renaissance encouraged curiosity and a desire for trade
* As a result of exploration, European nations grew powerful and spread their influence throughout the world
* Why did Europeans want to explore?
	* Gold (Money)
		* A desire for new sourced of wealth was the main reason for European exploration
		* The Crusades and Renaissance stimulated European desires for exotic Asian luxury goods
		* Merchants began looking for quick direct trade routes to Asia to avoid Muslim and Italian merchants and increase profits
	* Glory
		* The Renaissance inspired new possibilites for power and prestiege
		* Exploration presented Europeans the oppurtunity to rise from poverty and fame, fortune, and status
		* Kings who sponsored voyages of exploration gained overseas colonies, new sources of wealth for their nation, and increased power
	* God
		* European Christians, especially Catholics, wanted to stop the spread of Islam and convert non-Christians to the faith
		* Explorers were encouraged to spread Christianity or bring missionaries who would focus only on conversions
* Before the Renaissance, sailors did not have the technology to sail very far from Europe and return
* Trade and cultural diffusion during the Renaissance introduced new navigation techniques to Europeans
	* Magnetic compass made sailing more accurate
	* Astrolabe used stars to show direction
	* Maps were more accurate and used longitude and latitude
	* European shipbuilders built a better ship; The caravel was a strong ship that could travel in the open seas and shallow water
		* Caravels had triangular lateen sails that allowed ships to sail against the wind
	* A moveable rudder made the caravel more maneuverable
	* Cannons and rifles gave ships protection
* Who were the explorers, where did they go, and how did they change world history?
	1. Europeans were not the first to explore the oceans in search of new trade routes<br>
		1. Islamic empires explored the Indian ocean and had dominated the Asian spice trade for centuries before European exploration<br>
		1. From 1405 to 1433, Zheng He led the Chinese treasure fleet on 7 expeditions to Southeast Asia, India, and Africa during the Ming Dynasty<br>
	2. But in the late 1400s, the European sailors did what neither Muslim nor Chinese explorers could: Begin global (not regional) exploration and create colonies to increase their wealth and power
		1. Portugal was the early leader in Age of Exploration
			1.  In Portugal, Prince Henry the Navigator started a school of navigation to train sailors
				1.  He brought in Europe's best map-makers, shipbuilders, and sailing instructors
				1.  He wanted to discover new territories, find a quick trade route to Asia, and expand Portugal's power
				1.  Prince Henry's navigation school and willingness to fund voyages led the Portuguese to be the 1st to explore the west coast of Africa
			1.  Vasco de Gama was the 1st explorer to find a direct trade route to Asia by going around Africa to get to India
				1.  Portugal gained a sea route to Asia that brought them great wealth
				1.  During the Age of Exploration, Portugal created colonies along the African coast, in Brazil, and the spice islands in Asia
		1. The Spanish government saw Portugal's wealth and did not want to be left out
			1.  More than any other European monarch, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain sponsored and supported overseas expeditions
			1.  Like most educated men of the Renaissance, Columbus believed the world was round and thought we could reach Asia by sailing west
				1.  Columbus reached the Bahamas in America but thought that he had reached islands off the coast of India
				1.  He made 4 trips to "India" never knowing he was in "America"
			1.  Despite the fact that Columbus never found Asia, Ferdinand Magellan still thought he could reach Asia by sailing West
				1.  Magellan became the first explorer to circumnavigate the Earth
			1.  During the Age of Exploration, Spain created colonies in North and South America
			1.  Spain sent explorers called conquistadors to the New World to find gold, claim land, and spread Christianity
				1.  Cortes conquered the Aztecs
				1.  Pizarro conquered the Inca
			v1.  The influx of gold from America made Spain the most powerful country in Europe during the early years of the Age of Exploration
		1.  England, France, and the Netherlands became involved in overseas exploration and colonization as well
			1.  The French explorer Samuel de Champlain searched Canada for a northwest passage to Asia
				1.  After failing to do so, Champlain founded the French colony Quebec
				1.  The French would soon carve out a large colony along the Mississippi River from Canada to New Orleans
			1.  Unlike other European nations whose kings paid for colonies, the English colonies were paid for by citizens who formed joint-stock companies
				1.  English colonies formed along the Atlantic Coast of North America by colonists motivated either by religion or wealth
				1.  The English explorer James Cook was the first European to make contact with Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii
			1.  Like England, the Netherlands (the Dutch) allowed private companies to fund exploration
				1. The Dutch had colonies in America and Africa, but the Dutch East India Company dominated trade in Asia
* Impact of the Age of Exploration
	1. Europe was greatly impacted by the Age of Exploration
		1. Overseas colonies increased wealth of European nations, the power of kings (called nationalism)
			1.  This was especially true in Spain where the influx of gold turned Spain into one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations in Europe
		1. The increase in trade led to the growth of capitalism, especially in England and the Netherlands
			1.  Capitalism is a system in which merchants trade and invest money in order to make a profit; Prices are determined by supply and demand
			1.  Citizens can invest money in companies like the British East India Company and share in the profits
		1. Nations developed an economic policy called mercantilism based upon the idea that national power comes from a favorable balance of trade
		    1.  As a result, colonies are need to supply the mother country with cheap raw materials
			ii. Due to mercantilism, a "triangular trade" developed between Europe, their overseas colonies, and Africa
	2. Asia was greatly impacted by the Age of Exploration
		1. The Portuguese and Dutch seized trade ports in the Spice Islands and in India in order to gain exotic goods like cotton and spices
		1. European merchants began to dominate trade in China and Japan and converted many people to Christianity
	3. America was greatly impacted by the Age of Exploration
		1. Catholic missionaries introduced Christianity to the American Indians
		1. The introduction of new foods, plants, and animals between America and Europe was called the Columbian Exchange
			1. The introduction of potatoes and corn helped improve the diets and life expectancy of people throughout the world
			2.  The introduction of European grains, horses, and cattle transformed many Indian cultures
			3.  The introduction of European diseases like smallpox and influenza killed as many as 90% of Native Americans
		1. Europeans introduced the plantation system in America; These large cash crop farms were called encomiendas
			1. Encomiendas required a large supply of workers which increased the need for slaves
	4. Africa was greatly impacted by the Age of Exploration
		1. The demand for worked on American plantations, especially in the Caribbean and Brazil, led to the African slave trade
		1. For 300 years, slaves were sold in West Africa and brought to America along a route across the Atlantic Ocean known as the Middle Passage
		1. The majority of African slaves worked in harsh conditions on sugar and indigo plantations or in gold and silver mines
