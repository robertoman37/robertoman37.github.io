## <center>Atomic structure/ models
### <center>Evolution of the Atomic Model
* Democritus/ Dalton Model
    * Sphere that can't be broken down
* Thompson "Plum PUdding" Model
    * Electrons, no nucleus
* Rutherford Model
    * Electrons + positive Nucleus
    * Neutron not discovered
    * Why doesn't the electrons fall into the nucleus
### <center>Atomic orbital diagram
* Represents location of subatomic particles
    * Must include all parts: Protons, Neutrons, and electrons
* Bohr model: Electrons in the electrons cloud exist at different energy levels

* Developing this model:
    * Wavelength is inversely related to frequency related to frequency
        $$c=\lambda v$$
        * $C$ = speed of light (on reference page)
        * $\lambda$ = wavelength ($m$)
            * Must be in same units as $c$
        * $v$ = frequency ($hz$)($\frac{1}{sec}$)
    * Energy exists in quantized packets and is directly related to frequency
        $$E=hv$$
        * $E$ = energy
        * $h$ = plank's constant
        * $v$ = frequency
    * If energy is related to frequency and frequency is related to wavelength, Then energy must also be (inversely) related to wavelength
        $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
        * Same meanings for variables as previously stated
        * Not on reference page
### <center>Line Spectra
* Scientists studied emission spectra of inidividual elements
    * Elements emit unique wavelengths of light
    * When light strikes the surface of metals, electrons are ejected with a specific frequency
        * Intensity of the light doesn't matter
* Photoelectric effect
    * Increasing intensity of light has no effect on the emission spectra of elements
    * Led to idea that light exists as both a wave and a discreet packet of energy (photon)
    * Waves must fit perfects around the nucleus because there can be no constructive or destructive interference
        * Would otherwise cancel themselves out which is impossible
* Bohr Model
    * Based on quantized energy
    1. Only orbits of exact radii are permitted
    2. An "allowed" state is one in which an electrons has a specific energy
    3. As electrons move between "allowed states," a photon of energy is absorbed or emitted
    4. Increase energy releasted = increased frequency = decreased wavelength
### Energy sublevels
* Regions where an electrons is likely to be found
* Never know the EXACT location of an electron because they're always moving
* Way to show where electrons MIGHT be
* Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:
    * Can EITHER know the momentum OR the position - never both
* Schrodinger's wave function
    * Describes the probability of finding an electron in a given region of space
    $$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\textbf{r},t)=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi(\textbf{r},t)+V(r)\Psi(\textbf{r},t)$$
    ###### You will never need to know this equation, idk why I put this

### Electron Orbitals

* Electron's mass is so small they can be characterized as waves
    * Nodes give us specific shapes for regions of space where electrons can be found
    * Atomic orbital shapes define the region of space that encompasses the probability or electron density for an electron

### Electron sublevels

* Electrons are found in orbitals within sublevels

* Aufbau principle
    * Electrons fill lover energy levels first
    * Orbitals with same energy are called degenerate
* Pauli exclusion principle
    * Each orbital holds up to 2 electrons
    * Electrons in pairs spin in different directions
* Hund's rule
    * Electrons fill orbitals with same spin first THEN they pair with the opposite spin
* Exclusions
    * Completely-filled and 1/2 filled orbitals are more stable than partially filled
    * Group 6 and Group 11 move 1 electrons from "s" to "d"
    * Lots of other further down the periodic table
* practice
    * Mg: $[Ne]3s^2$
    * P: $[Ne]2s^2 3p^3$<br> 3 unpaired electrons
    * K: $[Ar]4s^1$
    * Cu: $[Ar]4s^1 3d^{10}$ (**THIS IS AN EXCEPTION**)
    * Cu<sup>+2</sup>: $[Ar]3d^9$
    * Ag: $[Kr]5s^1 4d^{10}$
    * Ag<sup>+1</sup>: $[Kr]3d^{10}$

* Valence Electrons Orbital Diagrams
    * Only write the electron configuration for valence electrons
        * Valence refers to electrons with highest level of energy
        * All other electrons are core electrons
    * s &amp; p block elements: valence are only in s &amp; block
    * d block elements: valence can be s and/ or d
    * examples:
        * Si: $3s^23p^2$
        * Fe: $4s^23d^6$
        * As: $2s^24p^5$

## Periodic Trends
### Effective Nuclear Charge
* Net positive charge experienced by valence electrons
    * Valence electrons are attracted to positive charge of the nucleus
    * Valence electrons also experience a "shielding effect" as core electrons shield the pull of the protons in the nucleus
* $Z_{eff} = protons - core\ e^-$
    * Trends
        * Increases across a period
        * Increases *slightly* down a group (because more protons in nucleus)
            * While the protons and electrons increase by the same amount, shielding becomes less effective, causing $Z_{eff}$ to be *slightly* larger

### Coulomb's Law
$F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$
* Describes the amount of force of attraction or repulsion experienced by charged particles
    * The closer two charges are to each other, the stronger the force is between them
    * The larger the magnitude of the charge(s), the stronger the force

### Atomic Radius
* Size of the atom
    * Decreases along a period
    * Increases down a group
    * Increases toward $Fr$
    * Inversely related to $Z_{eff}$

### Ionic Radius
* Radius of an atom that has lost or gained an electron
    * Cations - smaller
        * As electrons decrease, $Z_{eff}$ increases for cations, causing its size to decrease
    * Anions - larger
        * As electrons increase, $Z_{eff}$ decreases for anions, causing its size to increase

### Isoelectronic Species
* Isoelectronic - ions that have equal numbers of electrons
* Trend depends on the number of protons (increased Z = smaller radius)
    * largest in series is the highest positive charge

### Ionization Energy
* Energy needed to remove an electron from a neutral atom (in the gas phase)
    * $Na(g) + energy \rightarrow Na^+(g) + e^-$
* Increases along a period; Decreases down a group
    * Also increases with removal of successive electrons
    * Because $Z_{eff}$ Increases down a period

### Electronegativity
* Atom's relative ability to attract electrons in a chemical compound
    * Increase across a period
    * Decreases down a group
    * Increases toward $F$
    * Because $Z_{eff}$ increases

### Electron Affinity
* Mean of an element's desire to add an electrons (form an anion)
    * energy released when atom gets an electron
    * Trend is not clearly defined but tends to increase across a period and decrease down a group

## Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)
* Method for confirming electronic structure
* Directly measures the amount of energy required to remove each electron from an atom

### PES Spectra
* X axis is the energy
* Y axis is $\Delta e^-$

## Chemical bonds
* Formed by sharing or donating electrons between multiple atoms
* 3 main types:
    * Ionic - no sharing
    * Covalent - shared to various extents
    * Metallic - Occurs in pure metallic samples

### Ionic bonds
* Involves complete transfer of an electron
    * No sharing
* Typically occurs between metal and nonmetal
    * Metals lose electrons
    * Nonmetals gain electrons
    * Positive metal ion attracts negative nonmetal ion

### Electron dot diagrams
* Shows valence electrons around an atom
* To draw:
    1. Write the chemical symbol of the element
    2. Place one dot around the symbol for each valence electron(up to 8); do not fair until after the first 4 electrons
    Everything else is symbolized by the symbol
* Ex: $\ddot{He}$
* Properties:
    * Form crystalline lattices
        * Ions surround each other and pack close together
        * Net charge of lattice is 0
    * Strong electrolytes
    Have high melting points
    * Form hard, rigid, and brittle solids
* > Lattice energy - energy required to completely rip apart 1 mole of an ionic compound into gaseous ions
    * size of atoms is inversely related to it's lattice energy, which is directly proportional to the energy required to tear it.
* Results of coulombic forces
    * $E = \frac{kQ_1Q_2}{d^2}$
    * Q = charge = magnitude of charge $\uparrow$ = $\uparrow F$ ($\uparrow E$)
* Ion Formation and Electron configuration
    * Atoms bond in order to achieve stability
        * Group 18 elements are the ONLY stable elements
        * Other atoms can share, lose, or gain electrons while bonding with other atoms
        * Full outer energy level = stable (Octet rule)

## Covalent Bonding
* Electrons are shared
* **Important**: There is essentially a spectrum between ionic and covalent compounds based on electronegativity difference(s) in bonding atoms

### Bonding and Electronegativity
* Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
    * Electrons are shared equally
    * Very small difference in electronegativity
    * Diatomics are only pure nonpolar
* Polar covalent bonds
    * Electrons are shared unequally
    * Difference in element electronegativity causes unequal sharing of electrons
* Ionic bonds
    * Electrons are transferred because electronegativity values are SO different, that ions are created
    * Elements in the bond have electronegativity value difference greater than or equal to 2.5

### Dipole Moments
> Increased difference in electronegativity = increased polarity = dipole
* > **Dipole** - A molecule that has a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other
    * Caused by the moevemnt of electrons and the electronegativity of an element

### Lewis Dot Structures
* Representation of covalent bonds
* Indicates each atom, bonding electrons, and non-bonding electrons
* Multiple bonds may form due to sharing of more than 1 electron pair
    * **As bond order increases, bond length decreases**
* Drawing Lewis Dot Structures
    1. Determine how many valence electrons are available for the structure
    2. Most electronegative element is in center; connect everything to the middle atom
    3. Add electron pair to outside elements
    4. Check central atom
    5. Rearrange if needed

### Bond Enthalpy
* Enthalpy associated with the breaking of a chemical bond
* Can be used with Hess's Law to estimate the enthalpy of a reaction:
$$\Delta H_{rxn}=\sum\Big(\Delta H_{bonds\ broken}-\Delta H_{bonds\ broken}\Big)$$

### Formal Charge
* Equivalent to the total charge on the molecule
* Helps keep track of electrons in a molecule
* $Charge=Valence - bonds(lines)-unbonded\ electrons(dots)$
* Must consider formal charge when more than 1 lewis structure is possible:
    * Fewest number of atoms with a charge is *best*
    * Negative charges should be placed on atoms with greatest electronegativity values

### Resonance Structures
* Two or more Lewis structures are possible
* Bond length is between that of a single and a double bond

### Exceptions to the Octet Rule
* Already mentioned H, Be, and B as exceptions, but others exist
* Expanded octets:
    * S
    * I
    * Xe
    * P
    * Sb
    * Cl
    * As
    * Se
    * Br
    * Te
* All right next to each other in the periodic table
* Empty d-orbitals are capable of accepting electrons (and thus expanding the octet)

* Lewis structures with Expanded Octets
    1. Determine how many valence electrons available for the structure
    2. Element that requires most electrons is in center; connect everything to the middle atom
    3. Add electrons pairs to outside elements
    4. Check central atom and formal charge (especially with O)
    5. Rearrange if needed

### Odd Electron Species
* There are a few molecules that have an odd number of valence electrons
* Result: It is impossible to place an octet of electrons around each atom
