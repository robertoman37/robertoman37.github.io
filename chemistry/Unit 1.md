# Unit 1
## Solutions
### Aqueous Solutions
* All solutions consist of a solute and solvent
* >**Solvent** - bulk material; makes up most of the volume of the solution
* >**Solute** - minor constituent
* >**Aqueous solution** - water is the solvent

### Solvation Porcess
* >**Ioinic Compound** - stabilization of cation and anion (if aqueous)
* Molecular compounds that have a polar group are more soluble than those that don't
* >**Dissolution** - Act of process of dissolving into parts or elements
    * **Does not split into ions**
* >**Dissociation** - COmpounds separate into smaller particles such as atoms, ions, or radicals; depends on forces between atoms
    * ions
    * Ionic compounds always dissociate

### Electrolytes vs nonelectrolytes
* >**Electrolyte** - Solute dissociates into ions in aqueous solution; capable of conducting electricity
* >**Nonelectrolyte** - molecular compounds that may be soluble but do not conduct electricity

### Strong v Weak Electrolyte
* Most ionic compounds are electrolytes
* Some molecular compounds are weak electrolytes
    * Mainly organic acids
    * Weak electrolytes exist in a chemical equilibrium
* Strong Electrolytes
    * Strong Acids:
        * $HCl$
        * $HI$
        * $HNO_3$
        * $HClO_4$
        * $HClO_3$
        * $H2SO_4$
        * $HBr$
    * $NaCl$
    * $CaCl_2$
    * $NH_4Cl$
    * $KNO_3$
