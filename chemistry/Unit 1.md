# Unit 1
## Solutions
### Aqueous Solutions
* All solutions consist of a solute and solvent
* >**Solvent** - bulk material; makes up most of the volume of the solution
* >**Solute** - minor constituent
* >**Aqueous solution** - water is the solvent

### Solvation Porcess
* >**Ioinic Compound** - stabilization of cation and anion (if aqueous)
* Molecular compounds that have a polar group are more soluble than those that don't
* >**Dissolution** - Act of process of dissolving into parts or elements
    * **Does not split into ions**
* >**Dissociation** - COmpounds separate into smaller particles such as atoms, ions, or radicals; depends on forces between atoms
    * ions
    * Ionic compounds always dissociate

### Electrolytes vs nonelectrolytes
* >**Electrolyte** - Solute dissociates into ions in aqueous solution; capable of conducting electricity
* >**Nonelectrolyte** - molecular compounds that may be soluble but do not conduct electricity

### Strong v Weak Electrolyte
* Most ionic compounds are electrolytes
* Some molecular compounds are weak electrolytes
    * Mainly organic acids
    * Weak electrolytes exist in a chemical equilibrium
* Strong Electrolytes
    * Strong Acids:
        * $HCl$
        * $HI$
        * $HNO_3$
        * $HClO_4$
        * $HClO_3$
        * $H2SO_4$
        * $HBr$
    * $NaCl$
    * $CaCl_2$
    * $NH_4Cl$
    * $KNO_3$

## Precipitation reaction
* An insoluble compound is formed in aqueous solution and precipitates
* Determined using table of solubility
* Solubility rules
    * All nitrates are soluble
    * All acetates are soluble
    * Compounds with ammonium or an alkali metal are soluble
* >**Net ionic equation** - determine what ions take part in the metathesis reaction
    1. Write the products
    2. Break each soluble compounds into contituent ions
    3. Cross out spectators
    4. Remaining compounds constitute the net ionic equation
* eg. 1<br>
    $$Pb(NO_3)_{2}(aq)+2KI(aq)\rightarrow PbI_2(s)+2KNO_3(aq)$$
    Once crossing out spectators (not shown) we get
    $$Pb^{+2}(aq)+2I^-(aq)\rightarrow PbI_2(s)$$
* eg. 2<br>
    $$NaNO_3(aq)+KCl(aq)\rightarrow NaCl(aq)+KNO_3(aq)$$
    No reaction, all are aqueous
* eg. 3<br>
    $$2Li(s)+2H_2O(l)\rightarrow 2LiOH(aq)+H_2(g)$$
    $$2Li(s)+2H_2O(l)\rightarrow 2Li^+(aq)+OH^-(aq)+H_2(g)$$
* On most cases, you won't need to do this much work, but it helps to get a good understanding of it
## Acid-Base Reactions
* Acids
    * Produce $H^+$ ions in aqueous solution
    * $HCl(g)\rightarrow H^+(aq) + Cl^-$
* Bases
    * Produce $OH^-$ ions in aqueous solution
    * $NaOH(s)\rightarrow Na^+(aq)+OH^-$

## Neutralization Reaction
* Acids and bases react together to form water an an ionic salt
    * Neutralization reactions because water is neutral
    * After the reaction, the products have a pH closer to 7 than the reactants did
    * Net ionic equation is always $H^+(aq) + OH^- \rightarrow H_2O(l)$
## Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
* One or more electrons are transferred
* >**Oxidation** - Lose electron(s)
* >**Reduction** - Gain electron(s)
* Uses
    * Batteries
    * Combustion
    * Photosynthesis
    * Electron transport chain
* More electronegative element "controls" the electrons and is therefore reduced (gains electrons) in the reaction
    1. Determine oxidation state of most electronegative element
    2. Sum of oxidation states is 0 for neutral compound
* General Rules:
    * Single elements and diatomic molecules have oxidation state of "0"
    * Group 1 always +1
    * Group 2 always +2
    * H usually +1 unless paired element is less electronegative
        * *usually alkali metals*
* Practice:
    * $Mg^{+2}Cl_2^{-1}$
    * $C^{+4}O_2^{-2}$
    * $O^{+2}F_2^{-1}$
    * $H_2^{+1}O^{-2}$
    * $Cu_2^{+1}O^{-2}$
    * $C^{+4}Cl_4^{-1}$
    * $S^{+6}O_3^{-2}$
    * $H_2^{+1}O_2^{-1}$
    * $K^{+1}O^{-2}H^{+1}$
    * $(Cr_2^{+6}O_7^{-2})^{-2}$
* To qualify as redox, an oxidation state change must occur
* Predicted using the activity series
    * Any metal on the list can be oxidized by the one below it
* >**Oxidized** - reducing agent
* >**Reduced** - oxidizing agent
* CFU: identify which element is oxidized and which is reduced
    * $2Mg^0+O_2^0\rightarrow 2Mg^{+2}O^{-2}$<br>
        &nbsp;$Mg^{0\rightarrow +2}$ Lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$O^{0\rightarrow -2}$ gained electrons, reduced
    * $2Al^0 + 3I_2^0 \rightarrow 2Al^{+3}I_3^{-1}$<br>
        &nbsp;$Al^{0\rightarrow +3}$ Lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$I^{0\rightarrow +3}$ Gained electrons, reduced
    * $K^{0}+Na^{+1}O^{-2}H^{+1}\rightarrow Na^{0} + K^{+1}O^{-2}H^{+1}$
    * $4Fe^0 + 3O_2^0 \rightarrow 2Fe^{+3}O_3^{-2}$<br>
        &nbsp;$Fe$ lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$O$ gained electrons, reduced
    * $C^{-4}H_4^{+1}+O_2^0\rightarrow H_2^{+1}O^{-2}+C^{+4}O_2^{-2}$<br>
        &nbsp;$C$ lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$O$ gained electrons, reduced
* **NOTE**: elements can be both reduced and oxidized at the same time
