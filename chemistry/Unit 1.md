# Unit 1
## Solutions
### Aqueous Solutions
* All solutions consist of a solute and solvent
* >**Solvent** - bulk material; makes up most of the volume of the solution
* >**Solute** - minor constituent
* >**Aqueous solution** - water is the solvent

### Solvation Porcess
* >**Ioinic Compound** - stabilization of cation and anion (if aqueous)
* Molecular compounds that have a polar group are more soluble than those that don't
* >**Dissolution** - Act of process of dissolving into parts or elements
    * **Does not split into ions**
* >**Dissociation** - COmpounds separate into smaller particles such as atoms, ions, or radicals; depends on forces between atoms
    * ions
    * Ionic compounds always dissociate

### Electrolytes vs nonelectrolytes
* >**Electrolyte** - Solute dissociates into ions in aqueous solution; capable of conducting electricity
* >**Nonelectrolyte** - molecular compounds that may be soluble but do not conduct electricity

### Strong v Weak Electrolyte
* Most ionic compounds are electrolytes
* Some molecular compounds are weak electrolytes
    * Mainly organic acids
    * Weak electrolytes exist in a chemical equilibrium
* Strong Electrolytes
    * Strong Acids:
        * $HCl$
        * $HI$
        * $HNO_3$
        * $HClO_4$
        * $HClO_3$
        * $H2SO_4$
        * $HBr$
    * $NaCl$
    * $CaCl_2$
    * $NH_4Cl$
    * $KNO_3$

## Precipitation reaction
* An insoluble compound is formed in aqueous solution and precipitates
* Determined using table of solubility
* Solubility rules
    * All nitrates are soluble
    * All acetates are soluble
    * Compounds with ammonium or an alkali metal are soluble
* >**Net ionic equation** - determine what ions take part in the metathesis reaction
    1. Write the products
    2. Break each soluble compounds into contituent ions
    3. Cross out spectators
    4. Remaining compounds constitute the net ionic equation
* eg. 1<br>
    $$Pb(NO_3)_{2}(aq)+2KI(aq)\rightarrow PbI_2(s)+2KNO_3(aq)$$
    Once crossing out spectators (not shown) we get
    $$Pb^{+2}(aq)+2I^-(aq)\rightarrow PbI_2(s)$$
* eg. 2<br>
    $$NaNO_3(aq)+KCl(aq)\rightarrow NaCl(aq)+KNO_3(aq)$$
    No reaction, all are aqueous
* eg. 3<br>
    $$2Li(s)+2H_2O(l)\rightarrow 2LiOH(aq)+H_2(g)$$
    $$2Li(s)+2H_2O(l)\rightarrow 2Li^+(aq)+OH^-(aq)+H_2(g)$$
* On most cases, you won't need to do this much work, but it helps to get a good understanding of it

## Acid-Base Reactions
* Acids
    * Produce $H^+$ ions in aqueous solution
    * $HCl(g)\rightarrow H^+(aq) + Cl^-$
* Bases
    * Produce $OH^-$ ions in aqueous solution
    * $NaOH(s)\rightarrow Na^+(aq)+OH^-$

## Neutralization Reaction
* Acids and bases react together to form water an an ionic salt
    * Neutralization reactions because water is neutral
    * After the reaction, the products have a pH closer to 7 than the reactants did
    * Net ionic equation is always $H^+(aq) + OH^- \rightarrow H_2O(l)$

## Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
* One or more electrons are transferred
* >**Oxidation** - Lose electron(s)
* >**Reduction** - Gain electron(s)
* Uses
    * Batteries
    * Combustion
    * Photosynthesis
    * Electron transport chain
* More electronegative element "controls" the electrons and is therefore reduced (gains electrons) in the reaction
    1. Determine oxidation state of most electronegative element
    2. Sum of oxidation states is 0 for neutral compound
* General Rules:
    * Single elements and diatomic molecules have oxidation state of "0"
    * Group 1 always +1
    * Group 2 always +2
    * H usually +1 unless paired element is less electronegative
        * *usually alkali metals*
* Practice:
    * $Mg^{+2}Cl_2^{-1}$
    * $C^{+4}O_2^{-2}$
    * $O^{+2}F_2^{-1}$
    * $H_2^{+1}O^{-2}$
    * $Cu_2^{+1}O^{-2}$
    * $C^{+4}Cl_4^{-1}$
    * $S^{+6}O_3^{-2}$
    * $H_2^{+1}O_2^{-1}$
    * $K^{+1}O^{-2}H^{+1}$
    * $(Cr_2^{+6}O_7^{-2})^{-2}$
* To qualify as redox, an oxidation state change must occur
* Predicted using the activity series
    * Any metal on the list can be oxidized by the one below it
* >**Oxidized** - reducing agent
* >**Reduced** - oxidizing agent
* CFU: identify which element is oxidized and which is reduced
    * $2Mg^0+O_2^0\rightarrow 2Mg^{+2}O^{-2}$<br>
        &nbsp;$Mg^{0\rightarrow +2}$ Lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$O^{0\rightarrow -2}$ gained electrons, reduced
    * $2Al^0 + 3I_2^0 \rightarrow 2Al^{+3}I_3^{-1}$<br>
        &nbsp;$Al^{0\rightarrow +3}$ Lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$I^{0\rightarrow +3}$ Gained electrons, reduced
    * $K^{0}+Na^{+1}O^{-2}H^{+1}\rightarrow Na^{0} + K^{+1}O^{-2}H^{+1}$<br>
        &nbsp;$K$ Lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$Na$ Gained electrons, reduced
    * $4Fe^0 + 3O_2^0 \rightarrow 2Fe^{+3}O_3^{-2}$<br>
        &nbsp;$Fe$ lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$O$ gained electrons, reduced
    * $C^{-4}H_4^{+1}+O_2^0\rightarrow H_2^{+1}O^{-2}+C^{+4}O_2^{-2}$<br>
        &nbsp;$C$ lost electrons, oxidized<br>
        &nbsp;$O$ gained electrons, reduced
* **NOTE**: elements can be both reduced and oxidized at the same time

## Hydrates
> **hydrate** - Compound that contains water
* The number of water molecules becomes a prefix before the word "hydrate"
    * eg. Sodium carbonate decahydrate: $Na_2CO_3 * 10H_2O$
    * eg. Strontium chloride hexahydrate: $SrCO_2 * 6H_2O$

## Solution stoichometry
* Many ways to express concentration of a solution
    * Most common is molarity:
    $$Molarity=\frac{moles\ of\ solute}{Liters\ of\ solution}$$
    * eg.
    $$\frac{2.50L\ HNO_3}{1}*\frac{15.9mol\ HNO_3}{1L\ HNO_3}*\frac{63.02g\ HNO_3}{1mol\ HNO_3}=2505.045$$
* To decrease molarity, increase solvent
    * >**Dilute** - Make a solution weaker by adding water or another solvent
    $$M_1V_1=M_2V_2$$
* Making Dilutions
    1. Use the formula to determine the volume of stock solution needed
    2. Add solvent (usually water) until you reach the total volume needed for the diluted solution
    * eg. 1
    $$6.00M\ HCl*x=2.00M\ HCl*1.00L\ HCl$$
    $$x=\frac{2.00M\ HCl*1.00L\ HCl}{6.00M\ HCl}$$
    $$x=\frac{1}{3}L\ of\ 6.00M\ HCl$$
    $$1.00L-\frac{1}{3}L=\frac{2}{3}L\ water$$
    * eg. 2
    $$12.1M\ HCl*x=0.250M\ HCl*0.5L\ HCl$$
    $$x=\frac{0.250M\ HCl*500L\ HCl}{12.1M\ HCl}$$
    $$x=10.3mL\ HCl$$
    $$500mL-10.3mL=489.7mL\ solvent$$
* Solution stoichiometry
    * Most often applies to data obtained thorugh a titration
    * >**Titration** - technique for determining the amount of solute in a given sample
    * eg. 1
    $$3NaOH+Al(NO_3)_3\rightarrow Al(OH)_3+3NaNO_3$$
    $$\frac{0.5L\ NaOH}{1}*\frac{0.1mol\ NaOH}{1L\ NaOH}*\frac{1mol\ Al(OH)_3}{3mol\ NaOH}\\*\frac{78.004g\ Al(OH)_3}{1mol\ Al(OH)_3}=1.3g\ Al(OH)_3$$
    * eg. 2
    $$Na_2CO_3+2HCl\rightarrow 2NaCl+H_2CO_3$$
    $$\frac{0.210g\ Na_2CO_3}{1}*\frac{1mol\ Na_2CO_3}{83g\ Na_2CO_3}*\frac{2mol\ HCl}{1mol\ Na_2CO_3}*\frac{1}{5.50mL\ HCl}\\*\frac{100mL}{1L}=0.92M\ HCl$$
    * eg. 3
    $$2HNO_3+Ba(OH)_2\rightarrow 3HOH+Ba(NO_3)_2$$
    $$\frac{50.00mL\ Ba(OH)_2}{1}*\frac{1L\ Ba(OH)_2}{1000mL\ Ba(OH)_2}*\frac{0.033M\ Ba(OH)_2}{1L\ Ba(OH)_2}\\*\frac{2mol\ HNO_3}{1mol\ Ba(OH)_2}*\frac{1L}{0.223mol\ HNO_3}=0.015L\ HNO_3$$
# Thermochemistry
## Thermodynamics
* Remember:
    * On a fundamental level, chemistry deals directly with energy changes
* Thermodynamics describes effects of work, heat, and energy on a system
    * Describes energetic properties of substances
    * Helps predict if a chemical change will occur

## Energy
* Driver of all changes
* Flows between objects and spreads throughout the universe
* Examples:
    * Kinetic, potential, etc.
* Kinetic v potential:
    * Kinetic - energy of motion
    * 

* Energy Transfer
    * When high energy particles collide with lower energy energy particles, energy is transferred
    * Eventually, each particle will posses an equal amount of energy (on average)
* Chemistry focuses on energy changes
    * Usually just deals with heat (q)
    * Work comes into play if dealing with a gas that causes expansion or deflation
* System v surroundings
    * The system is usually the chemical reaction
    * The surroundings usually refers to everything else
* Difficult to measure the energy of a system
    * apply the First Law of Thermodynamics: $\Delta E=E_{final}-E_{initial}$
    * Energy lost to surroundings: $E_{final}<E_{initial}$
    * Energy gained from surroundings: $E_{final}>E_{initial}$
* Considering only the transfer of heat, can classify chemical reactions based on changes in energy:
    * Endothermic - heat is absorbed by the system
        * Surroundings get colder
    * Exothermic - heat released by system
        * Surroundings get warmer
* Law of conservation of energy:
    * energy ins't created or destroyed, its transferred
* Transferred in two ways:
    * Work (w)
        * $F*d$ or $-p \Delta V$
    * Heat (q)
        * Thermal energy moving between substances
* Adding thermal energy results in results in increase in temperature
    * Heat capacity - amount of heat energy required to raise temperature by 1 C or 1 K
    * Specific heat capacity - 1 gram of a substance is studied
    * Molar heat capacity - 1 mole of a substance is applied
    * $q=mc\Delta T$

##  Calorimetry
* Process of measuring the amount of heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction
Reaction must be isolated so that no heat is lost to the environment
* Calorimeters insulate the reaction to better contain heat
    * Use thermometer to measure change in temperature
* Amount of thermal energy released or absorbed by a chemical reaction can be measured in 2 ways
    * Constant pressure calorimetry: $q=mc\Delta T$
    * Constant volume (bomb) calorimetry: $q_{rxn}=-C_{cal}*\Delta T$
* Law of Conservation of energy states taht energy can't be created or destroyed
* Calorimetry takes advantage of this
    * Heat is difficult to measure directly, but mass, specific heat, and changes in temperature are not
    * $q_{solution} + q_{substance} = 0$
    * $q_{solution}=-q_{substance}$
    * $q_{surroundings}=-q_{system}$

## Enthalphy
* Quantifies the heat flow into or out of a system in a process that occurs at constant pressure
    * $H = Enthalpy$
    * $\Delta H = H_{products}-H_{reactants}$
    * $\Delta H=\Delta E+P\Delta V$
* At constant pressure
    * $q_p=\Delta E + P\Delta V$
* Because enthalpy is related to energy, we cna also use it to describe chemical reactions
* Endothermic absorbs heat
    * heat is a reactant
* Exothermic releases heat
    * heat is a product
* Calorimetry uses the mass of a solution to provide information about heat absorbed or released
* Enthalpy is measured in kJ/mol
* Knowing heat and mass we can calculate enthalpy of a reaction
* Steps:
    1. Use $q=mc\Delta T$
        * Use total mass of the solution in the calorimeter
        * Assume all products are at the same ending temp
        * Use specific heat of excess reactant
    2. Use mass of the limiting reactant to determine moles
    3. Divide q by moles to determine enthalpy
