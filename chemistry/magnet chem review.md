# Everything from Magnet chem [^1]
## Unit 1
---
Ok, unit 1 doesn't really cover anything important, so I'll be super brief:
* Don't be an idiot in labs
* The scientific method is a thing
* Know some basic science vocab
* Dimensional analysis
    * Ok, this is actually kinda important. You can convert between different units by putting the unit that you want to convert on top of a fraction with a 1 in the denominator, then multiply that fraction by a fraction with its denominator the unit you're converting, the top the unit you're converting to, and the fraction equal to the conversion ratio[^2]
    * ex: $$\frac{2.65m}{1}*\frac{10^2cm}{1m}=265cm$$
* Significant figures exist, they really aren't that difficult.
    * Counting sig figs:
        * If there is a decimal count from the left
            * ex: 0000567.234 = 6 sig figs
        * If there isn't a decimal, count from the right
            * ex: 2345 = 4 sig figs
        * zeros don't count
        * more sig figs = greater accuracy
        * always answer in the amount of sig figs given unless stated otherwise
    * Rules:
        * When adding and subtracting, use the same amount of decimal places as the least precise place value
        * When muliplying and dividing, use the same amount of sig figs as the value with fewest number of sig figs [^3]
* Oh yeah, scientific notation. I don't need to explain that
* Physical and Chemical changes are easy. If it changes the appearance of an object, its a physical change. If it changes the chemical makeup of an object, its a chemical change.
* Calculate density by dividing mass over volume
* Vocab!
    * > **heterogenous** - partially mixed
    * > **homogenous** - fully mixed
* and that's it!

## Unit 2

Ok, here's where it actually starts
### Atomic Structure
---
* We start off with super basic chem stuff

* The periodic table has three different sections.
    * Occupying most of the middle and left sides are the metals.
    * Occupying the right side/ slant is nonmetals
    * Occupying a tiny slant are the metalloids.
* Neutral Atom
    * An atom is neutral when it has no charge.
    * This ONLY happens when the number of protons equals the number of electrons
* Isotope
    > An atom of the same element with a different number of neutrons
    * Some isotopes can be stable, and some decay over time
* Ion
    > An atom that has lost or gained electrons and has a charge
    * Atoms DO NOT gain or lose protons to become an ion. If that happens, it is a completely different element
    > **Cation** - positively charged ion<br>
    > **Anion** - negatively charged ion
* > **Atomic Mass** - The average mass of all isotopes of an element
    * Can easily be found on the periodic table.
    * Is a weighted average based on the abondance of the isotopes.
* Symbols/ notation for ions/ elements
    * $$^d_ca^b$$
    * >**a** - name of the element<br>
    * >**b** - charge of the element
    * >**c** - atomic number (number of protons)
    * >**d** - mass of the element (protons + neutrons)

### Isotopes
---
> different versions of the same element. Has differing masses, but still the same element
* Isotope notation
    * The name of the element followed by its mass
    * **ex**: `carbon - 12`
* Average Atomic Mass
    * You can calculate average atomic masses by multiplying the percent abundance of all the mass contributions and then adding them up
    * **ex**: <br>The fictional element candium has three different masses each with different percent abundance as shown in the table<br><table><tr><th>Name</th><th># of Isotope</th><th>Abundance<th></tr><td>Candium - 2</td><td>76</td><td>0.67</td></tr><tr><td>Candium - 3</td><td>33</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>Candium - 5</td><td>4</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td>113</td><td>1.00</td></tr></table>We can calculate the mass contribution for each element by mutliplying the isotope mass by the isotope abundance<br>Candium - 2: $0.67 * 2.02 = 1.35$<br>Candium - 3: $0.29 * 3.00 = 0.87$<br>Candium - 5: $0.04 * 5.01 = 0.20$<br>Next by adding these values together, we can finally get the Average Atomic Mass<br>$$1.35 + 0.87 + 0.20 = 2.42$$
* Different Isotopic Notation
    $$^A_ZX^C$$
    * >**A** - Mass Number
    * >**Z** - Atomic Number
    * >**X** - Element symbol
    * >**C** - Charge

### Nuclear Chemistry
---
> The subdiscipline that is concerned with changes in the stability of elements, which are the source of radioactivity
* >**Nucleons** - All the particles that make up the nucleus
* >**Mass detect** - the difference ebtween the total mass of the individual nucleons, and the nucleus as a whole
* >**Binding energy** - The energy that holds the nucleus together
* >**Nuclear energy** - The energy released when a nucleon is removed
* Fission
    > The division of one heavy nucleus into two lighter ones
    * Used for energy production
    * Releases a lot of energy
    * Can be used in chain reactions
    * Most common fuel is Uranium - 235

* Fusion
    > Joining of two lighter nuclei to form a heavier one
    * Produces more energy than fusion
    * Usually can't be used in chain reactions

* Half life
    > Fixed rate of decay for an isotope
    * How long it takes for half of the atom to decay
    * $Half\ lives = \frac{Time\ Passed}{time\ in\ half\ life}$
    * Can be used to date things[^5]

### Radioactivity and Nuclear Decay
---
* Nuclear stability
    * Determined by the ration of neutron to protons
    * When this ration is incorrect, atoms begin radioactive decay
* Radioactive decay
    * Random and spontaneous breakdown of unstable nucleus
    * Three types:
        * Alpha radiation
            * Emits 2 protons and neutrons ($^4_2He^{+2}$)
            * Least dangerous form of radiation
            * Mass is reuced by 4, and atomic number is reduced by 2
        * Beta radiation
            * Emits a single electron ($^0_{-1}e^{-1}$)
            * Medium Dangerousness
            * Mass is unchanged, atomic number increases by 1
        * Gamma radiation
            * emits a gamma particle ($\gamma$)
            * Most dangerous
            * Both mass and atomic number are unchanged
        * There are more forms, but they aren't important, so let's move on.

### History of Atomic Theory
---
Ok, this part is really boring, so I'll go through it really quickly
* John Dalton
    * Made the first modern atomic theory
    * Thought atoms were the smallest unit possible
    * His model was literally just a circle

* J. J. Thompson
    * Discovered the electron
    * encorporated the electron into Dalton's model

* Ernest Rutherford
    * Discovered the nucleus
    * Completely differnt model
    * electrons float around a nucleus

* Niels Bohr
    * proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus
    * same as Rutherford's model, except that the orbits of the electrons are drawn

* James Chadwick
    * Discovered the neutron which is found in the nucleus

**and that's all folks, now onto unit 3!**

## Unit 3
### Absorption and emission
* >**Valence Electrons** - found in the outermost energy level of the electron cloud. Most atoms want 8
    * H, He, Li, Be, and B actually want 2 [^6]
    * Atoms are chemically stable when they have these 8 valence electrons
* >**Oxidation number** - number of electrons lost, gained, or shared
    * Really just the charge of the element when an ion
* >**Electromagnetic Radiation** - form of energy that exhibits wavelike behavior as it travels through space
    * It's range of frequencies is called the electromagnetic spectrum (EM Spectrum)
    * Visible light is on the EM Spectrum
* Electrons
    * Electrons of an atom normally want to be at the lowest energy level possible, but they can go to higher energy levels when they absorb energy
    * >**ground state** - the lowest possible energy state of an atom
    * >**excited** - any energy state above the ground state
    * Eventually electrons have to lose this energy, to do this they emit energy, in the case of light, in the form of a photon
    * Each atom emits a specific range of energy, which produces a different light when put under a flame
* Parts of a wave
    * > **origin** - where the cycle starts and ends
    * > **crest** - top of the wave
    * > **trough** - bottom of the wave
    * > **amplitude** - distance from origin to crest or trough
    * > **wavelength** - distance between equivalent parts of a wave
    * > **frequency** - number of waves that pass a given point per second

* Wave Equations
    $$E=hv$$
    $$c=\lambda v$$
    $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
    * E = energy
    * h = Plank's constant ($6.626*10^{-34}$)
    * v = frequency
    * c = speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)
    * $\lambda$ = wavelength

### Electron Configuration
* >**Heisenbrug Uncertainty Principle** - It is impossible to measure both the Location and the Velocity of an electron at the same time
* Electron Configuration
    > way of the showing the structure of electrons in an atom
    * > **energy level** - region of space aroudn the nucleus where electrons are likely to be
        * Within an energy level, you have sublevels (a, p, d, and f)
* >**Aufleau principle** - electrons fill the lowest available energy level before filling a higher energy orbital
* >**Pauli exclusion principle** - mas of 2 electrons per orbital, and they msut have opposite spins
* >**Hund's Rule** - all equal energy orbitals must get 1 electron before any get 2 electrons
* How to write this out
    * You write this out by first writing the energy level, then the sublevel, and then the number of electrons in the orbital
        * **ex**: Carbon: $1s^22s^22p^2$
    * You can also shortcut this method by basing it off of the closest noble gas
        * **ex**: zinc: $[Ar]4s^23d^{10}$
    * Also, for Lewis Dot Structure, you draw dots around the

[^2]: I explained that horribly, but whatever
[^3]: They sound the same, I promise you they aren't
[^4]: slightly more than 1 amu, but it really doesn't matter
[^5]: No example problems, it's really self-explanatory
[^6]: This is because their outermost shell is their innermost as well
