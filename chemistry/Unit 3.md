# Unit 3
## Gas Laws
### Pressure
* In physical terms pressure is defined as force per unit area($P=\frac{F}{A}$)
* This idea can be extended to include the force applied by a column of air on the Earth's surface

### Atmospheric Pressure
* This pressure applied by the gas of the atmosphere (or atmospheric pressure) can be derived as follows:
    * Imagine a column of air 1m<sup>2</sup> at its base and extending to the upper atmosphere
    $$F=ma$$
    $$F=(10,000\ Kg)(9.8\ m/s^2) = 1*10^5N$$
    $$P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{1*10^5}{1m^2}=1*10^5N/m^2=1*10^5Pa$$

### Standard Atmospheric Pressure
* Standard atmospheric pressure refers to the pressure required to support a column of Hg(l) 760 mm high
* Can be expressed in a variety of units:
    <center>1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr = 101.325</center>

### Boyle's Law(Pressure/Volume)
* Robert Boyle is credited with experimentally determining the relationship between pressure and volume of gases
$$PV=constant$$
